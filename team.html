        Rohi is a senior currently attending Leland High School and is excited for her fourth year with Quixilver 8404! She has had a lot of fun with Lego robotics and now really enjoys mechanical work. Mechanical work always fascinated Rohi; in general “working with her hands” makes her happy. Other than robotics, Rohi plays the piano where she is currently working on her diploma and she participates in sports, one of which is badminton. Rohi is an avid lover of nature and all the animals in it. At the moment she has a betta fish and hopes to get many more pets in the future. You can often find her in her garage just having fun with random materials.

        Alex is a senior at Leland High and is excited to continue his journey on this team. He has always had a passion for working on large intellectual projects and enjoys working closely with his friends. Prior to joining the team, Alex did FLL for several years in elementary school and also learned to code in his free time. He knows Python, Java, and a little bit of C++. Alex is looking forward to his time in 8404, hoping to improve his coding skills, make new friends, and tackle difficult challenges. Outside of school, Alex enjoys playing the piano, listening to music, and practicing math (he hopes to qualify for USAMO this year!).​

        Lin is a senior at Leland High School and is excited to participate in his second year with Quixilver 8404! Lin first learned Python in middle school, and has gradually developed experience in C++ and Rust as well. Ever since his first encounters with computers at a young age, Lin has developed a passion for computer science, particularly in algorithms and cybersecurity. Recognizing that programming bridges humans and computers, Lin believes that mastering this language is vital for daily life. He is looking forward to applying his skills on the team to tackle many challenges. Outside of robotics, Lin loves to play piano, which he has won many competitions in and volunteers to play for charity. Lin also enjoys mathematics and you can also often find him experimenting with computer software.
